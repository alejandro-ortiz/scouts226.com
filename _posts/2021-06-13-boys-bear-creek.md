The boys had a really good time at bear creek! They got to do all sorts of fun
things like archery, riffle, and the first years did the ranger program which
was a little bit of everything so everybody had lots to do. One of the best
parts of camp is seeing all the firsts years and the patrols learn more about
eachother over the week and work together better. I think that everyone in the
troop learned a few good lessons and is exited for next campout.
